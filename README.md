# ModChangerVersion
Basically, ModChangerVersion lets you easily change the version of a mod to another Minecraft version.

⚠️ Warning ⚠️

For the moment this is the first version, I'm not going to update it. Basically the version for Forge mods doesn't work at the moment, so to modify the verison you'd have to do it manually for all curseforge mods, sorry.

To run it you need to install the Python software and I haven't tested it on Linux, only on Windows, so I don't guarantee that it will work on Linux.
